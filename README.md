# Spatial Measurement System

Embedded spatial measurement system using a VL53L1X time-of-flight sensor to acquire information from the surrounding area.  A 28BYJ-48 stepper motor provided the 360 degree rotation, allowing the sensor to be mounted on top and measure distances within a single vertical geometric plane (y-z).  Mapped spatial information is stored in the MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller memory and later communicated to a personal computer for reconstruction and graphical presentation. The data was processed in Microsoft Excel and modelled with MeshLab.
